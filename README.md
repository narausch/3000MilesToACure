## About Brain Cancer

Brain cancer is one of the deadliest cancers in the world. Within five years of diagnosis, 3 out of every 4 patients will die. Some brain cancers, like glioblastoma multiforme, have a median survival rate of one to two years, even with aggressive chemotherapy and radiation.

In  estimated 69,720 cases of primary brain tumors will be diagnosed. Approximately 4,300 children younger than 20 will be diagnosed. Brain cancer is the number two cause of cancer deaths in children.
